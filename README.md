# Steps to run app :rocket:
1. copy .env.test template 
2. replace name .env.test to .env
3. replace .env information with valid one
4. npm i
5. npm run start


### Project Notes:
- worker and app are in the same app

- to run worker, you must set env var ENABLE_SYNC_WORKER to "true"

- local films and external films differs in one property: externalId.
externalId field its used to distinguish one from other.

- worker syncs external films by default (that means that by default, local films created by api are not deleted, you can enable this behavior with an specific option)

- worker now runs every 20 seconds, you should change this in the code `@Cron` decorator with desired value.
